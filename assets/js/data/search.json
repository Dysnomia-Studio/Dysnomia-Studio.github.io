Eventually, I had to rest and not touch the game for a month and a half. It‚Äôs not great marketing-wise to not update the game or write this DevBlog earlier, but it was healthier for me and the game‚Äôs future.After updating Alchemistry early November (I wrote most of the update on November 9th but published 10 days later), I decided I would slow down and work only on the projects when I felt like working, so I spent my free time relaxing on some other things such as Factorio: Space Age DLC, yep üòÅI also spent my time on non-IT things such as this cute Lego set:Eventually, I feel better and am back working on all the projects at a better pace. But, I didn‚Äôt write a single addition line of code on Manufactur‚Äôinc. So, what‚Äôs next?Manufactur‚Äôinc futureAs some of you already know, I was supposed to release the game on January 13th, but it won‚Äôt be released on that date, I canceled my plans.Here‚Äôs what I planned for the future: Updating the demo until we have a good UI/UX, all the main game features but not all the content Preparing the Early Access content Publishing a release date announcement along with a definitive trailer (a temporary one will probably be published in the meantime) Release the gameThat means the game as it exists today will continue to live and evolve, and I will release it if and only if I still feel okay working on it until it‚Äôs stable enough.‚ÄúWhen ?‚Äù, will be your next question, I‚Äôm sure. To be honest: I don‚Äôt know, in 3 months? 6? a year?It will totally depend on how I feel mentally in the next few months.Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs left from Devblog #7 list:To be considered ‚Äústable‚Äù, here‚Äôs the list of things I expect to do (some are already Work-In-Progress in the future 0.3.3 update): Improve server performances: Make the simulation run faster on the server (WIP) Stop trying to automatically link the machines and storage and automatically do that when moving/building/deleting (WIP, Breaking change) Limit how much offline time can be calculated at login (WIP) Maybe rewrite the whole factory simulation system with another and faster programming language (I‚Äôd prefer to avoid this, but can if needed) Prevent factory size from growing exponentially by: Making market prices dynamic (the more the player base buys something, the more its price increases; the more player base sells something, the more its price decreases) Add energy management Add staff management Make various (needed) quality-of-life improvements Make various server optimizations to make it lighter on the server CPU/database (and faster for the player) Fix both Linux and MacOS versions (the MacOS version is not sure since the bug is not in my hands but in the Webkit team‚Äôs hands :/) Make more contracts and make them different from the existing ones Improve the current ‚Äútech tree‚Äù to prevent everyone from needing the same resource and selling the same one, as well as some balance Manual linking/resource choice for a storage slot to complete the optimization listed in the first bullet pointAs you can see, 0.3.3 already fixed the ‚Äúmost urgent stuff‚Äù but there‚Äôs still plenty of (cool) work on the game!ConclusionTo conclude, I want to thank every single person who tested the game, gave feedback, followed or wishlisted the Steam page, shared the game, translated the game, ‚Ä¶ You are the people motivating me and helping me to make this game.If you want to follow my gamedev journey you can: Follow/Wishlist the Steam Page to see these DevBlogs Join Dysnomia‚Äôs Discord Follow me on Bluesky Follow me on Twitch where I sometimes do game development live (in French, but I answer English questions!)And don‚Äôt forget to wishlist and share the game with your friends: this is a great way to help me achieve this game I‚Äôm dreaming of!Thanks for reading this DevBlog, and see you soon!Elanis" }, { "title": "Manufactur&#39;inc DevBlog #7 - Lessons learned from the Steam Next Fest", "url": "/posts/manufacturinc-devblog-7/", "categories": "gamedev", "tags": "gamedev, steam, devblog, manufacturinc", "date": "2024-10-22 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "This post was originally published on SteamDevblog history 09/2023 - #1 - Who?

Finally, we will talk about the future of the gameFor those who didn‚Äôt play the game demo: I had and still have some major bugs in the game which handicapped the demo growth. A new patch is in development as I write these lines. Why didn‚Äôt I release this earlier? Well: busy schedule, mental health, lots of reasons, and some of them will be explained here :)Next Fest FiguresLet‚Äôs share some figures about the game demo:As you can see, more than 2.5k people added the game demo to their accounts. And more than 1.6k people played it. The median played time is caused by this server bug as well as a ‚Äútoo minimalistic‚Äù tutorial.But if you look at the average time played and other stats, there are still hundreds of people who enjoyed the game and even dozens who played more than a few hours!Another view on the stats I have, are the Concurrent players and Daily Active users!Here are the concurrent players, from SteamDB (updated every 10 minutes), and from my server (updated every minute):Finally, the Daily Active Users, compared to the daily wishlists and followers.For a comparison, a normal day is 2-5 wishlists, and I gained 800 in 14 months up to the Next Fest, on the follower side, it was 70 followers in 14 monthsDoing more than x2 in wishlists is what I expected with a stable game, so I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm really happy with these figures.Want another mind-blowing figure? How much visibility do you think Next Fest gives? The answer: tonsLast but not least, I tried having an automated livestream despite it wasn‚Äôt featured anymore. And I was positively surprised it was watched that much!We can estimate around 11k people watched the stream during the week, and here are the concurrent viewers‚Äô stats (the gap in the middle is a crash of the machine that was streaming during the night üòÖ).My mental healthI talked about it on multiple occasions (on Discord, on Bluesky, and in the release notes here), this week has been really overwhelming emotionally.Firstly, I didn‚Äôt expect that many people to try out the demo in the first days.Secondly, because I had lots of feedback ‚Ä¶ and bugs to fix. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am really thankful to everyone who tried the game and gave feedback, but it was a lot for ‚Äúmy solo myself‚Äù to work on everything at the same time (despite taking days off work for this purpose).Lastly, there were some performance issues on the serverside part of the game where factory simulation would become really, really long with the biggest factories, and that‚Äôs basically what focused my attention for the main part of the week. This is one of the main issues I will have to spend time working on ‚Ä¶ and will impact/change some core processes of the game (I will talk about it in the next section).Eventually, by Thursday, I had to take some time off working on the game because I felt worse and worse. Don‚Äôt worry: now, I feel better and am back working on the game, but since it‚Äôs a free-time project, I will be working on this only during my evenings and weekends so the updates will take some time.So, for the game dev and other creators around here, I have something to tell, never go past your limit: burnout comes easily. It‚Äôs the second time in my (short) gamedev life I feel burnout is close to my door and avoid it by just accepting to let go.And secondly, never forget why you‚Äôre creating: I sometimes forget that I mainly create for players AND me to have fun. Have fun by playing, and working on the games. I love having ‚Äútechnical fun‚Äù, this is my drive here, so let‚Äôs not forget that :)The game futureNow that the low-key depressing/very serious part is done, let‚Äôs discuss the game‚Äôs future!The game was supposed to be released in around 3 months, let‚Äôs face it: I am not sure I will be able to meet this deadline. And I‚Äôd prefer changing the release date if this means I have a more stable and mature game to release.To be considered ‚Äústable‚Äù, here‚Äôs the list of things I expect to do (some are already Work-In-Progress in the future 0.3.3 update): Improve server performances: Make the simulation run faster on the server (WIP) Stop trying to automatically link the machines and storage and automatically do that when moving/building/deleting (WIP, Breaking change) Limit how much offline time can be calculated at login (WIP) Maybe rewrite the whole factory simulation system with another and faster programming language (I‚Äôd prefer to avoid this, but can if needed) Prevent factory size from growing exponentially by: Making market prices dynamic (the more the player base buys something, the more its price increases; the more player base sells something, the more its price decreases) Add energy management Add staff management Make various (needed) quality-of-life improvements Make various server optimizations to make it lighter on the server CPU/database (and faster for the player) Fix both Linux and MacOS versions (the MacOS version is not sure since the bug is not in my hands but in the Webkit team‚Äôs hands :/) Make more contracts and make them different from the existing ones Improve the current ‚Äútech tree‚Äù to prevent everyone from needing the same resource and selling the same one, as well as some balance Manual linking/resource choice for a storage slot to complete the optimization listed in the first bullet pointOnce all of this is stable, I can announce a release date, and focus on the last Early access features: Ecological and ethical decisions Automatic buy/sell resources More content (contracts, resources, machines, ‚Ä¶) More community-wide features to enhance the MMO side Maybe target more platforms than Steam?But don‚Äôt worry about the demo, it will be updated along these milestones. Because I need your input and feedback!Note that the demo will stay up, even when the game is released. The difference between both game versions will be the game content size. The demo will have fewer contracts, resources, and machines. And probably a low staff size limit.ConclusionI am done with this seventh DevBlog.

(Here !)Hello, fellow future entrepreneurs!As I explained on multiple occasions Discord, Bluesky, and Mastodon, I am currently renovating my house and participated to GDC, thus why I skipped March for a DevBlog and slowed down development during these months. But here I am, back with a brand new Devblog! I will still work less than usual during the end of April and early May, but we will see my free time returning to a normal state during late spring and summer!Working on this game in my free time is surely an unstable situation, but fortunately, I enjoy it a lot! :)Let‚Äôs get back to this DevBlog subject now: Today, I will talk about an administrative tool I‚Äôve been building for a few months now, which will help me to build the game, especially when creating new content updates during the early access phase and afterward!Why build this tool?You could wonder why I would need to build this tool since there are probably existing ones on the market or I could work without it.And this is a good question actually.I am building this tool for multiple reasons: This is a game-specific tool so I can‚Äôt find something similar on the internet I like to automate and simplify lots of processes, the goal being to have a smooth and easy experience while creating content for my projects. I wanted to ditch the ‚Äúboring stuff‚Äù and focus on creating more in an equivalent timespan. I wanted a tool that helped me to see the existing stuff (items, equipment, recipes, contracts,‚Ä¶) so I don‚Äôt create duplicate elements, can keep them coherent, and balance them without many issues.So, this is why I created this tool! (WIP)As you can see, it‚Äôs not as pretty as the game interface, but we don‚Äôt really care since the only user will probably be me. I will focus on some good user experience, such as this:It is in active development along with another tool that can apply balancing to the game server live, and the game itself of course.And for those who have followed me for a longer time, you know it‚Äôs not the only tool I‚Äôve been creating for my games, since I also built a translation tool for my oldest games a few years agoThis is of course a time investment, but it helps me add new items/equipment metadata in a matter of minutes.What‚Äôs left afterward when adding this kind of stuff are the graphics ‚Ä¶ and this is a whole other topic.Using these tools, I will be able to focus on writing new features, improve the User Experience, and just improve the game itself.If you‚Äôre curious about other things I use to improve my productivity on Manufactur‚Äôinc and my previous games, I suggest you read about Manufactur‚Äôinc 2nd DevBlog about automation.If you liked this DevBlog, you can read the other ones and share them with your friends.And one way to not miss the following ones is to follow the game Hub, using the ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù button on the Steam page.And if you‚Äôre interested, I would also be happy if you wishlisted the game as well.If you are interested to follow me elsewhere and get more than a monthly update about the game state, you can: Join Dysnomia‚Äôs Discord Follow me on Tiktok (I will try to post as much as I can here, but it takes a lot of time !)

There are several contract durations:Global contractsGlobal contracts are one-shot and lifetime contracts, they will be used for various purposes from tutorial to ‚Äútechnology tree unlocking‚Äù. The goals of these contracts will be to help you know more about the gameplay, and of course, unlock new exciting resources or equipment for your company!Some of them will be mandatory for you to pursue further in gameplay, and some others will only help you build your company.Limited duration eventsMost of the non-mandatory ones will be timed events whether it be daily, weekly, monthly, or event-based events the goal will be to give you equipment to build or resources to produce in exchange for some great rewards!These events, along with some balancing updates, will also be created to force players to renew/grow their production in multiple directions and avoid niche-based fortunes.Okay, that‚Äôs great, but what kind of rewards can I win with these contracts?Lots of possibilities will be available, the most obvious one is of course money, but you could also get various resources, get a temporary employee happiness buff, unlock equipment, other contracts, new game features, achievements, ‚Ä¶Ah, this looks great, but does that mean I have to fill contracts to be sure progressing in the game?Filling contracts will be a huge plus to your business, but it‚Äôs not and will not be the only way to succeed in and enjoy the game.

I plan to add all-around-the-year in-game events linked to various cultures‚Äô festivities!Events ?That‚Äôs a feature I like as a player in online games such as Grepolis and World of Warships or solo games such as Cookie Clicker, basing some gameplay on festivities.Yeah, okay, you want to do a Christmas-themed event like other games? Huh?Yes, you are right, fake opposition voice in my head, but not completely. I really would like to implement various events if not every month, at least every other month.** Yes, I‚Äôm having fun doing these silly questions/answers with myself.And that‚Äôs where I need you, the players! Which festivities are important to you?I already thought about multiple ideas including but not limited to: (Occidental or Chinese) New year Valentine‚Äôs Day Easter Some Summer thingy Haloween ChristmasSo, if you have ideas or agree with some of these, please comment on this post and tell me what‚Äôs important to you! It is important to me to get feedback from players, and even more for this possible feature :)It doesn‚Äôt have to be occidental or widespread festivities and I‚Äôm willing to consider any interesting idea. So do not fear giving any of your ideas.What could these events bring the the game?I have multiple ideas but the main content this would bring are contracts (~in-game quests) specific to these events. E.g. ‚ÄúProduce 1000 units of chocolate‚Äù for the Easter event. And, it will probably be a chain of contracts.Btw, we will talk about contracts in detail in a dedicated (future) DevBlog. Stay tuned!I also would like to give some temporary price variations for specific resources/items. In this same easter event, we could also raise chocolate prices because, well, demand increases.(The market and prices system will also have its own future DevBlog!)A third idea I have is to use these events as an excuse to write some major updates introducing brand new resources or tools!I basically have tons of ideas and am convinced these events could bring lots of fun, and additional and different gameplay all along the year :)ConclusionThis DevBlog has been a bit shorter than usual, but I was mainly writing it to get your ideas!.

What? Where? When? 10/2023 - #2 - Automation isn‚Äôt just about gameplay 12/2023 - #3 - Logistics (Here !)Greetings, fellow entrepreneurs!Welcome to this third DevBlog of Manufactur‚Äôinc! As you probably noticed, it‚Äôs already been two months since the previous one. But don‚Äôt worry, there will be two in December (next one in a week!).The subject of this third DevBlog is a cornerstone of the gameplay: resources management.History and proof or conceptThe old systemUntil November, there was a proof of concept of the gameplay allowing me to work, try features, and play. Here‚Äôs how it worked: it has a global resource storage - like you can find in most management/strategy games - meaning if you had a saw, it would take wood logs from global storage and produce planks to this global storage pool, without any transportation delay.The reworkThis was a good and easy proof of concept but ‚Ä¶ not the best idea in terms of gameplay and fun. So, I decided to completely rework this part of the game during my holidays week in early November.It took a bit more than expected, because I didn‚Äôt have a first working version before the end of November, and still have some nonworking edge cases at the moment I write these lines.Why does it take so long?It takes a long time to develop because Manufactur‚Äôinc is and will be a multiplayer and real-time game. This means when you log in to the game, it will have to recalculate what has been happening for your industry since last session. Whether it be an hour ‚Ä¶ or a full year. So I have to introduce some shortcuts to be able to simulate these big durations as ‚Äúrepeating this pattern X times‚Äù. Basically: it‚Äôs a complex workload!But, what is this new system?This new system has two major differences from the previous one: I am introducing ‚Äúlocal‚Äù storage: each tool and each ‚Äúwarehouse‚Äù has its internal storage. It means we will check this storage to know if we can produce a resource (if the output slot is full or if you don‚Äôt have the input material, you can‚Äôt produce!). There will also be some resource transit between equipments. When your saw needs to produce planks, it will first need to bring some wood logs from the relevant storage, wait for them to come, produce, and then extract planks from output storage to the destination.TestsI won‚Äôt go into technical details, but as presented in the second devblog, I write automated tests for most of the game systems. This one is not different; I‚Äôve been writing tons of tests for this system, including some targeted tests as well as some complete factory simulations (especially the one you will have by the end of the first tutorial!).Okay, that‚Äôs cool, but do you have visuals ?!Yes! While most of the work is behind the scenes, I have some visuals to share, especially this GIF of the first version of game client animation representing the simulation:And if you‚Äôre curious how it evolved during time: ConclusionHere we are for this Devblog! Did you like this little behind-the-scenes?If you have questions about the game, you can add a comment under this post and I‚Äôd love to talk about it, or maybe even write a future DevBlog on this subject!You can also join Dysnomia‚Äôs discord so we can talk about this!If you are interested to follow me elsewhere and get more than a monthly update about the game state, you can: Join Dysnomia‚Äôs Discord Follow me on Tiktok (I will try to post as much as I can here, but it takes a lot of time !)

I hope to share pieces of my developer life with everyone here without going into technical details :)Auto-updatesSomething that made me lose a lot of time on my first game was releasing updates. You can‚Äôt imagine how it‚Äôs a pain to manually build a game build for 3 Operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and two architectures each (32bits/64bits, except for MacOS which only has the latter).So, something I set up 3 years ago with Exortion was to automatically create all 5 builds on a server every time I was going to ‚Äúsave my code‚Äù on the server.It reduced the time I dedicated to releasing an update from 1+ hour to ~15 minutes: download 5 .zip files from my server, upload to Steam and itch, trigger Steam update, and here we go!‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool‚Äù you would like to say?Yes, but some improvements were still possible!One year later, I was using SteamCMD to automatically push to Steam servers and Butler to push to itch.io automatically.What do I still have to do now? Press the release button, and write a nice update announcement!So here‚Äôs what it looks like now for Exortion‚Äôs demo for example, pretty cool no ? üòÅOf course, Manufactur‚Äôinc already has this, from day one of development (and that‚Äôs really cool to have !):Automated testingAnother important topic that took up a lot of time in repetitive actions was testing. Being able to re-test every feature of a game before updating is something almost impossible when done manually (and we‚Äôre not even talking about the time spent !).Automated testing is something common in my original development field (web development) and I wanted to bring this to my games as well, it easily prevents tons of bugs (not all, unfortunately !) and can test dozens of times faster than a human does, while being less error-prone!So, how and what do I test? I do two kinds of tests: Feature specific tests (called unit tests) ‚ÄúGlobal‚Äù test (called end-to-end)Unit testsA good example of unit test is about this part of UI:I have to test that the number is displayed correctly, e.g.‚Äú123‚Äù is displayed as ‚Äú123‚Äù‚Äú1230‚Äù as ‚Äú1.23K‚Äù‚Äú1200001‚Äù as ‚Äú1.2M‚Äùand so onSo, I write lots of rules about this, and every time I run tests, it will check that this is okay! So, if ever I modify the system because I need to have ‚ÄúP‚Äù after ‚ÄúK‚Äù (=1 000), ‚ÄúM‚Äù (=1 000 000), ‚ÄúG‚Äù (=1 000 000 000), ‚ÄúT‚Äù (=1 000 000 000 000), I can be sure I didn‚Äôt accidentally break anything!End-to-end testsAs for end-to-end tests, I will test a scenario from start to end, e.g: Login to the game Place a building Check that resource X is generating Go to the contracts tab Check that we succeed contact Y (because it asked to construct this building) and so onIf you want to see what it looks like for Alchemistry you can watch a video here (Sorry, I can‚Äôt embed it on Steam !).Or another cool example of Extortion:End-to-end testing and administration tools have been both my main focus since the game announcement (hence why I‚Äôm talking about this here). Those tools will both make me work easier and faster in the future (and I will need this since I will be solo on this project !).ConclusionI hope you liked this little behind-the-scene of game development!If you think things could be improved, you can add a comment under this post and I‚Äôd love to talk about it!

What? Where? When? (Here !)Hello there!Welcome to this first DevBlog of Manufactur‚Äôinc! I plan to write monthly DevBlog like this one throughout the entire development process. We will talk about: gameplay, choices, behind-the-scenes content, and various other subjects!I don‚Äôt intend to get too technical here (you can find technical blogs on Dysnomia‚Äôs blog). However, I want to share my journey in creating this game and, of course, get your opinions on various aspects!Today, there won‚Äôt be any pictures, but I expect to include images of new and updated content in each upcoming DevBlog.But first:Who am I ?I am Axel, aka Elanis, and I am a solo developer. I worked on multiple games, websites, and various other projects in the past. I created Dysnomia to take ownership of my projects and, perhaps one day, turn it into my full-time job!Currently, this company mainly serves for freelance work, which occupies most of my week. This means I am working on this game as well as updating previous ones during my free time.What is Manufactur‚Äôinc ?As stated on the Store page, it‚Äôs a company and industry abstract management game. That means that you will have to grow, blueprint, optimize, and control your company to reach your objectives and compete with other players.But what are your objectives?Unlike many other games, I don‚Äôt want money to be the sole objective and metric of your company, I want to introduce choices: Whether it will be choosing your energy source, your workers‚Äô conditions, or anything else, it will be up to you to decide which decisions suit your style.I also want to pave your way with multiple contracts (global, weekly, daily, themed events) that can guide you into new and different experiences!As you can see, I have tons of ideas, and it will be a lot of work. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve chosen to divide the development into multiple phases: Alpha versions, where I will be the only one testing the game Playtest versions, where a limited number of people would be chosen to test balance and gameplay Early access, where content will be added as waves, and I would continue to balance the game based on feedback 1.* versions, where I would have a balanced game and gameplay, with enough content to be played, but still updates to add more content, contracts, and events.When and where will it be released?My current estimation is it will be released in early access during Q4 2024 or Q1 2025, and the 1.0 version would come between 12 and 18 months later. But those are estimations, they are subject to change, especially depending on how easy/hard things are to do, how easy/hard I can create tools to make my life easier for following updates, and finally, how much time I need to get enough visibility to prevent the game failing on launch.I am confident about the first and second items, but the third item is up to you: so please, if you are interested in this game, wishlist and follow the game page. And if you think some of your friends might like it, share the game page as well. It would mean a lot to me to see people curious about the game :)The game is planned to be released on Steam for sure, targeting Windows, Linux (especially the Steam Deck), and MacOS. I also would like to add more stores to the list, but we‚Äôll see if there‚Äôs a chance for me to do so!If you are interested to follow me elsewhere and get more than a monthly update about the game state, you can: Join Dysnomia‚Äôs Discord Follow me on Tiktok (I will try to post as much as I can here, but it takes a lot of time !)

Now that I precisely have the figures up to March 2023, I‚Äôm going to do a summary of that first year or so.The game launched with ~1.8k wishlists, which is a lot compared to my previous game (~400), thanks to Steam Next Fest (2 weeks before launch) which gave ~1.5k wishlists. After launch, there was another spike when reaching the 10th review then it fell slowly until Puzzle Fest 2023 which saw another small increase.Followers had the same trend as wishlists, It was at 87 (1/21 ratio) at launch, 24 (1/10 ratio) before Next Fest, and now am at 173 followers (1/12 ratio) on the Steam page.(Source: https://steamdb.info/app/1730540/charts/ )The last stats before we talk money, are visits and impressions. Seeing a total of 140k visits and 1.8M impressions is mind-blowing for the small developer writing this. On these graphs, we can clearly see 3 big spikes (next fest, release, 10th review) and their tail.Here we are for the juicy stats (1st year only):Copies sold: 726 (-101 returns)Wishlists: 3365 total, -1020 deletion, -316 Purchases/GiftsGross revenues: ~3.2k$Net Steam revenues (after VAT, returns, chargebacks): ~2.5k $After Steam part/Currency conversion fees: ~1.7k $After taxes: ~1.2k $Median time played: 27 minutes (Estimated life: 3 hours)Lifetime unique users: 678 (93%)And about the Demo (1st year only):Demo total units: 14k (including 7.4k before launch)Lifetime unique users: ~3kMedian time played (demo): 6 minutes (Estimated life: 15 minutes)I spent 221 hours working on the game (development, marketing, etc.), including 79.5 hours after release day. All of that was during my free time (game dev isn‚Äôt my main work yet). I have been able to release 4 patches, 3 major updates, and 5 regular ones e.g. Steam Deck supportA final note about those graphs: you might notice I get more ‚Äúactivity‚Äù from ~nov. 2022.

I hoped to earn a few more wishlists, but I got far more than I expected. Here‚Äôs a small article describing my journey during this crazy week.LayoutThe first thing to talk about is the Next Fest page layout. You can filter it by game categories, then you have sections with subcategories (with game placement randomized). That layout was my first luck. Why? Because in the ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù tab, the first section was ‚Äúminimalist puzzles‚Äù and ‚Ä¶ I was there with Alchemistry.As you can imagine, being able to be on the top of the page, even on a ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù page, helps a lot with visibility. And that was completely based on Steam choices, not mine, the first element was luck.LivestreamsThe second element is less about luck. Steam lets developers organize up to 2 Steam Next Fest livestreams that will be featured for an hour on the Next Fest page. I chose dates and times and planned a duration of a few hours, but having different content from the other indie devs, I wanted to stream as I do on Saturday on my Twitch channel (I speak French, but answer in English as well if you pass by üòÑ), I wanted to work on the game and talk about it with people.So I started this live stream on Tuesday 22nd, 10 PM CEST, and surprise, almost 2k viewers at the start second, that was pretty stressful at first but then I managed to stream a few hours without problem. The featured hour got between 1.5k and 2k viewers, enormous, and the next one, a few hundred viewers.Keep in mind that I‚Äôm used to having 1-5 viewers on Twitch, it‚Äôs a bit different.I did the same thing on Saturday 26th morning and got less visibility, but still hundreds of viewers, far more than I expected!Even after a month, having the graph a bit flattened (the oldest event has originally been seen only a few hundred times), we still see huge differences between next-fest event and non-next-fest ones:The DemoWell, Steam Next Fest is about game demos, I should talk a bit about it as well. This demo was released months before Steam Next Fest but didn‚Äôt get a lot of visibility. I worked on the demo as a limited version of the game (less content, but the same features).I like to work this way because I think that‚Äôs a fair way to present the game to people and game feedback from players.I managed to have 20 elements and 5 challenges, enough to play for at least 15 minutes if you‚Äôre fast, 30 if you‚Äôre more chill.I got nice visibility and feedback from people but ‚Ä¶ not enough because some bugs weren‚Äôt spotted before the final game release (I probably will talk about it more deeply in another blog post). Conclusion: be sure you have easy click-to-action to let players contact you.StatisticsNow, don‚Äôt lie, you‚Äôre here for them (:D), let‚Äôs throw some graphs. I will keep a few days before and after the Next Fest to see the differences, the event goes from Feb. 21st to Feb 28thView amount on Steam PageWishlistsDemo concurrent usersDiscordThe Discord community is pretty small, but it still grew during and since the Next Fest.TwitterI have no graph for this one, as I manually count, but Dysnomia: posted/commented 6 times have been retweeted 9 times have been liked 15 times have been mentioned 2 times have been quoted in a blog post 1 time gained 4 followers (17 =&amp;gt; 21)ConclusionAs you can see, even with a small community, and a small marketing, you can gain a lot of visibility if you have some time to invest in nice screenshots, a trailer, and a livestream. I strongly encourage any indie dev to seriously try out Steam Next Fest if they can.If you want to check out my game, you can go on Steam. I will post some other blog posts about the game and game dev shortly :)" }, { "title": "Post-mortem Extortion - Publishing my first game on Steam", "url": "/posts/post-mortem-extortion/", "categories": "gamedev", "tags": "gamedev, steam, marketing, extortion, post-mortem", "date": "2021-08-28 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "10 months ago, on October 30th, 2020, I published my first game on Steam ‚ÄúExtortion‚Äù, it‚Äôs a game where you‚Äôre playing a computer engineer who is being blackmailed and forced to hack some servers.After a few demands, I decided to write a small article about every step from preparation to publishing of my game, and the following months.Project genesisExtortion was born in late February 2020 during ‚ÄúNot a Gamejam‚Äù, a GameJam created by the French development server called ‚ÄúNot A Name‚Äù. This GameJam lasted 2 weeks and made me create the beginning of the game‚Äôs story, which is now the story of the game Demo. I liked this project and decided to continue development during the following months, and then publish it on Steam.To the original 15-minute gameplay chapter, I added 7 other chapters which compile into a full story.Preparing Steam publishingUntil June 2017, Steam was validating games through Steam Greenlight, a platform where the community was (in)validating games based on their interest. Since Greenlight‚Äôs stop, we now use Steam Direct.Steam Direct is now simpler, and follows these steps: Creation of a Steamworks account Paying a $100 Valve publication fee Validation of store page by Valve Validation of game build, trailer, and planned release date by Valve Publication of the game by the developer or the editorMarketing and wishlistA very important thing about game publishing is to advertise the game. We often want to begin advertising when the game is about to be released when we have full game potential to show, but it‚Äôs a mistake. You have to build a community around the game from development start to gain more and more wishlists on Steam. Wishlists are a very important metric when launching a game.Indeed, a game with many wishlists, and a strong (in terms of copies sold) start, will be highlighted by Steam and will be even more sold.You have to keep in mind that the wishlist conversion rate of a game is really low. It‚Äôs often only between a few percent and a few dozen for really attractive games. Indeed, a 10,000-person wishlist will only be converted into a few hundred copies sold.Warning: A game that is not selling in the first week is dead. There are some exceptions like Among Us, but it had a big and sudden communication from Twitch, but it‚Äôs pretty uncommon.On the Extortion side, I got a conversion rate of around 8% in the first week, which represents around 40 of the 103 copies sold in this period.How to communicate about your game?As said before, it‚Äôs really important to communicate during the whole development duration. But, the way to communicate and the frequency are as important. You should use animated images (GIF, webp, short videos) instead of pictures because they attract attention. You also have to communicate often - even if that‚Äôs just a picture - at least once a week.Where should you communicate about your game?On Twitter: Using #screenshotsaturday or #wip, for example. You can also use some common hashtags - that are retweeted by specialized bots and game studios. Those hashtags are #gamedev, #indiedev, #indiegame, #indie, #IndieGameDev, ‚Ä¶ You give a short description, a link, and of course, a GIF.On Reddit: In subreddits like: r/IndieDev, r/IndieGaming, and r/playmygame (this one only if you have a free demo or a free game), ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs important to follow each subreddit rules. For example, some are limiting paying games, posting frequency, or even when to post. Like Twitter, use a GIF or a short video, and post links in the comments.On Imgur: By giving a few tags about your game type (or generic ones like ‚Äúgamedev‚Äù by default), talking about and describing your picture, don‚Äôt hesitate to talk about your content!In your favorite communities: Share around you, talking or writing, but always follow these communities‚Äô rules. The objective is to have people know about your game!Take care of self-promotion abuse! On Reddit, but also Imgur and other platforms, avoid only publishing self-promotional content. There‚Äôs a nice article about that on Reddit Wiki, especially about the 1/10 rule.Conditions around Steam publishingUnlike some other platforms - like Epic Games for example - there are no exclusive rights when using Steam. But there are some rules: having the same price everywhere, and updating/releasing at the same time as other platforms.On the financial side, Steam takes a part of your revenues (after removing VAT) of 30% for revenues between 0 and 1 million dollars, 25% between 1 and 50 million, and 20% over 50 million. Steam manages VAT payments and currency exchange; you don‚Äôt have to think about that.Steam lets you get freely as many game keys as you want. You can sell them, and give them to the press, influencers, testers, and so on. I personally used them to make some people test Extortion before release and to give game copies when participating in a game award (but I wasn‚Äôt qualified).There are also Steam Curatiors, you can give them copies of your games and they will test and review your game. They might even test your game on Twitch! The curators‚Äô system is safer than giving keys because they can‚Äôt sell those copies.Getting your revenues in your bank accountSteam only pays with dollar currency, using SWIFT payments. You‚Äôll need a bank account that accepts dollars and doesn‚Äôt take too much percentage when converting currencies (if you need to convert) or because of foreign payments.I don‚Äôt advise using standard banks (at least in France, where I experimented with that), because my own bank took 14% on my first payment (that‚Äôs a lot !). It‚Äôs often better to use a specialized service like Wise (Not sponsored btw, I just had a good experience with them).Payment are done when you reach $100, 30 days after the end of the month that reached that money. You can also raise the minimum amount to optimize bank costs.Choosing the priceThe price is on your own, you can choose it on a grid between $0 and $199.99. Currency-specific prices will be given to you based on each currency and country economy by Steam, you can customize those prices as well. You can also customize discounts (see next chapter). Price can change during the game‚Äôs lifetime (early access, release, reevaluating price, and so on).When I chose Extortion‚Äôs price, I based my price on a similar game I knew, Hacknet, and lowered it a bit (because my game wouldn‚Äôt be as good, and I knew it). So, I chose $5.99 and Steam proposed a converted price in euros of 4‚Ç¨99, a price that I accepted.DiscountWhen doing launch week, you can choose a discount of up to 40%, this discount isn‚Äôt mandatory but recommended to be able to profit from your more important week in terms of visibility. Then you can‚Äôt set a discount for 6 weeks.You‚Äôre invited (except for the first 6 weeks) to every major Steam sale, and you can choose to participate or not, and the discount you want to apply (without any limit).You can also create your own discount period (from 1 to 14 days long).When you modify your game price, you‚Äôre not able to have a discount for 30 days.My own advice is to set a discount at every Steam discount event, raising slowly the discount with time. Discounts are the main way to convert wishlists to sales.Available servicesI tested achievements, demo, Steam Cloud, and Steam overlay but there are plenty of available tools (and they are all free !): Workshop, DLC, friends list, community, market, leaderboards, game license authentication (serverside AND clientside), Valve Anti-Cheat, and so on.See Steam DocumentationUpdating and publishing a gameSteam has a private/public branch system to help us publish different game versions. You can then, for example, next to the default branch, have a public beta branch - like I did for Extortion. You could also have a private beta branch, or a branch by major version - like Factorio does for example.Publishing files can be done via Web UI (if the game is lighter than 2 GB), or using SteamCMD which works pretty well with a Continuous Integration system.ResultsAbout results, I wanted Extortion to reach 30 or 40 copies sold to be able to pay the $100 Steam fee. But I did far more than that! Here‚Äôs a summary table of my game life: ¬† Launch After 1 week After 1 month After 6 month After 1 year After 2 years Wishlist 412 544 635 810 831 960 Demo Download 2,802 2,834 2,864 3,649 4,621 6,533 Copies Sold 0 103 136 216 258 306 Return 0 (0%) 11 (10.7%) 14 (10.3%) 19 (8.8%) 23 (8.8%) 29 (9.4%) Raw revenues 1 $0 $455 $635 $1,045 $1,227 $1,420 1: From raw revenues, you have to remove returns, VAT, Steam part (30%), tax, bank costs (e.g. $ =&amp;gt; ‚Ç¨ change costs), and so on.As you can see, the first week is really important in terms of visibility and revenues.Edit 12/2022: I updated the table to add the ‚ÄúAfter 2 years column‚Äù, you can see that there was a bump in attractivity, caused by adding new tags on the store page in September.ConclusionThat was a small return on experience about the Extortion publishing process.

Fortunately, it‚Äôs easy to avoid that problem:[] === 0; // false&quot;0&quot; === 0; // false[] === &quot;0&quot;; // falseThe difference between == and === is that the first one checks equality between values (it can cast type to compare), and the second one checks the type and the value.typeof and instanceofThose two keywords can have unexpected behavior, for example with string type:typeof &quot;chaine de caractere&quot;; // &quot;string&quot;&quot;chaine de caractere&quot; instanceof String; // falseThis is not really a bug, but a wrongly defined behavior, because you can write:(new String(&quot;chaine de caractere&quot;)) instanceof String; // trueWe can note that the ‚Äúprimitive variable‚Äù string isn‚Äôt considered as its object equivalent.Another example of typeof issue often used to mock the language is:typeof NaN; // &quot;number&quot;Yes, you read right, NaN - Not a Number - is considered as a number when using the typeof operator. And that same category, null is considered of type object. But as for String, null is not instanceof Object, same for NaN and Number.False issuesWhile doing my research to write that article, I noticed some issues were listed that are not - by mistake or bad faith - real issues, I‚Äôll talk about some of them.Order of numbersMath.min() &amp;lt; Math.max() // falseWhen I saw that example for the first time, I doubted the language and its conception. Then, I did some research about those two functions. Math.min() and Math.max() do not give minimum and maximum numbers - as we can think - but minimum and maximum of their arguments. The algorithm for Math.max() has as a default value Infinity and compares with each parameter.Math.min() // InfinityMath.max() // -InfinityThe real issue of those functions, is, that they shouldn‚Äôt accept when the developer isn‚Äôt giving any argument.Immutability and variable hoistingA very often reported problem in the past was about the variable hoisting and its immutability. This was fixed in ES6 when the standard added the keywords let and const. We can also talk about Object.freeze() that is going to apply even more immutability restrictions than const.Offside issuesFew issues can be considered as ‚Äúoffside‚Äù because not about the language itself. One of these problems is the floating numbers representation.0.1+0.2==0.3; // false, because equal to 0.30000000000000004 when using standard float representationMain solution to those issuesAfter reading those lists of negative and positive points, we can see that there are plenty of easy-to-make (and to-solve) problems. Fortunately, there are plenty of code checkers that we call ‚ÄúLinter‚Äù that can help you with that. There‚Äôs for example: eslint, jshint, or jslint that you can add (or have already added) to your text editor or your IDE.I could also talk (and I will probably do in a future article) about code quality tools - working with any language like Sonarqube or Codacy.JSFuckThe last subject of that article is about JSFuck (http://www.jsfuck.com). It‚Äôs a fun syntax when you code JavaScript with only 6 different characters and you‚Äôre able to write any JavaScript code.It‚Äôs about being able to push the language to its limits using some (good or bad) behavior of the engine to be able to run the script.If you wanna read more about how it works, you can go on their official website: http://www.jsfuck.comConclusionDon‚Äôt hesitate to share that page if you have a debate about the advantages and drawbacks of JavaScript.
